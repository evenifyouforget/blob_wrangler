It has long been a dream to doodle some crap in MS Paint, and then get an actual level layout FCML out of it.

With the power of vibe coding (ew), we are now one step closer to that dream.

This is the image AI we needed.

## It all started as an experiment

I didn't even think this was going to work.
I had my algorithms and math knowledge, but I was kind of lazy and didn't want to program the hard parts myself.
So instead of doing the easy thing and doing it manually, I made AI do it for me. And it got it wrong. A lot.
But eventually I got a result that actually seems like it might be useful.

If it's useful, why not share it with the world?

## Vibe coding and maintainability

I realize if I'm going to release this repo, I'll need to start taking responsibility for my code.
And that means I can't just let Gemini do whatever it wants anymore.
Development may be slowed, but I hope I can reach a good balance of putting out new features, and not turning the codebase into unmaintainable spaghetti.
